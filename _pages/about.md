At the margin (En El Margen) is where decisions in economics are made. It's about taking a step back from the usually busy twitter-world (or the fun, but still superficial Insta-universe). It's about understanding second-derivative implications of what is happening. 

Thinking about the **bigger** picture requires time to sit, think and write and having this space is a commitment to doing it more often. 

This space started in 2011, going thru transformations of style, substance, writers and owners between then and now. 

While small, and just personal now, I aspire to keep this baby alive.
